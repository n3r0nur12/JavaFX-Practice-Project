        courseTree[3]={}
        courseTree[4]={}

        BUT...
        IN OUR SIMULATION WE HAVE ASSUMED MANDATORY COURSES ARE ONLY AVAILABLE FOR A
        PARTICULAR SEMESTER. SO, CSE3063 WILL ONLY BE LISTED IN FALL SEMESTER AND IT
        WILL NEVER BE LISTED IN SPRING SEMESTER.

        In Marmara University, a student can retake classes with latter grades DC and DD.
        But approval of the advisor is needed. We will allow student to add these DD and DC
        classes if she wants to do so. But, advisor will say the final word.
        We will generate a random integer. If it is divisible by two then, the advisor will allow
        student to take these DD and DC classes. Otherwise, student will not be able to take
        these DD,DC classes.

        Little not that a student with CGPA lower than 1.8 MUST retake these DD and DC classes.
        Later, the registration system will handle this condition.
